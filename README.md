# Forensic Gait Analysis

Forensic Gait Analysis is a tool that compares two video footages, one from a crime scene and another from a suspect, to determine if they depict the same person based on their gait patterns.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/forensic-gait-analysis.git
    cd forensic-gait-analysis
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Step 1: Preprocess the Videos

1. Update the paths in `preprocess.py` to point to the crime scene and suspect videos.
2. Run the preprocessing script to convert each video to 20 fps and trim them to 6 seconds:

    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```

### Step 2: Calculate Keypoints

1. Update the paths in `pose.py` to point to the processed videos.
2. Run the keypoint calculation script to generate keypoint data for each frame:

    ```bash
    python pose.py
    ```

3. **Example Output (Keypoints Extraction):**
    ```
    Loading sequences...

    Extracting keypoints...
    Frame data shape: (120, 56)
    Number of values in first frame: 56
    First frame keypoints length: 49
    Frame data shape: (120, 56)
    Number of values in first frame: 56
    First frame keypoints length: 49
    ```

   This output shows the process of loading the video frames and extracting keypoints. The data shape and the number of keypoints per frame are displayed to verify the extraction.

4. **Example Image (Keypoints Visualization):**

   The above image visualizes the detected keypoints (such as joints and limbs) for a frame in the video. This step captures and marks body keypoints to extract gait-related features.

### Step 3: Calculate Gait Similarity

1. Update the paths in `gait-similarity.py` to point to the folder containing the keypoint labels.
2. Run the gait similarity calculation and visualization script:

    ```bash
    python gait-similarity.py
    ```

3. **Example Output (Gait Similarity Analysis):**
    ```

    ```

4. **Example Image (Gait Similarity Visualization):**
   ![Gait Similarity Visualization](images/visualization.png)

   The above image shows a visual comparison of gait features extracted from the two sequences. Each featureâ€™s similarity score and an overall score are provided to help identify if the two footages depict the same person.

## Example

After completing the steps above, the `gait-similarity.py` script will output a similarity score and visualizations to help identify if the two footages depict the same person based on gait analysis.
